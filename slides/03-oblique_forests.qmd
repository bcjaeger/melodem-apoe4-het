# What does oblique mean?

## Background

Axis-based splits (left) and oblique splits (right)

![](img/axis_versus_oblique.png){fig-align="center"}

---

## Oblique tree: first split

:::{.column width="30%"}

First, split mostly by bill length

:::

:::{.column width="69%"}

```{r}
penguin_figs$oblique_1
```

:::

---

## Oblique tree: second split

:::{.column width="30%"}

First, split mostly by bill length

<br/>

Second, make a triangle for the gentoo.

:::

:::{.column width="69%"}

```{r}
penguin_figs$oblique_2
```

:::

## Oblique random forests

:::{.column width="30%"}

Aggregating randomized trees gives the *oblique* random forest

:::

:::{.column width="69%"}

```{r}
penguin_figs$oblique_3
```

:::

---

## Surprisingly different!

:::{.column width="30%"}

Despite very many similarities, axis-based and oblique random forests may give different results.

:::

:::{.column width="69%"}

```{r}
penguin_figs$axis_3d
```

:::

## Prior benchmarks

- @breiman2001random found oblique random forests compared more favorably to boosting than axis based ones.

- @menze2011oblique coined the term 'oblique' random forest and introduced variable importance metrics for it.

- On benchmarking 190 classifiers on 121 public datasets, @katuwal2020heterogeneous found variations on the oblique random forests were the top 3 classifiers.

:::footer
Leo Breiman named it "Forest-RC" but it later came to be known as oblique
:::

**Yet, everyone uses axis-based random forests. Few people even know that oblique random forests exist.**

# `aorsf` <br/>accelerated oblique random (survival) forest

## What is the problem?

Oblique random forests are slow. How slow, you ask?

```{r, warning=FALSE, echo=TRUE, cache=TRUE}

library(ODRF)
library(ranger)
library(microbenchmark)

microbenchmark(
  ODRF = ODRF(species ~ bill_length_mm + flipper_length_mm, 
              data = penguins, 
              ntrees = 500),
  ranger = ranger(species ~ bill_length_mm + flipper_length_mm,
                  data = penguins,
                  num.trees = 500),
  times = 5
)



```

## Why so slow?

Suppose we're given $p$ continuous predictors, each with $k$ unique values.

- If predictor has $k$ unique values $\Rightarrow$ max $k-2$ potential splits

- At most, $p \cdot (k-2)$ axis-based splits to assess

Suppose we assess $L$ linear combinations of predictors:

- At most, $L \cdot (k-2)$ oblique splits to assess

Usually, $L \gg p$ to find good oblique splits

## Find 1 **good** linear combination?

What if we use a method like regression to find $L=1$ linear combination?

$$\text{Time to assess an oblique split }= R + S$$

Where

- $R$ is time to fit regression

- $S$ is time to assess up to $k-2$ splits

If $R$ is small, we can do okay with this!
    
## But $R$ is not small

It takes $\approx$ 2.5ms for 1 oblique split, <20ms to fit 500 axis-based trees...


```{r, echo=TRUE, cache=TRUE}

# compare time for 1 oblique split to 500 axis-based trees
microbenchmark(
  # 1 oblique split
  glm = glm(I(species == 'Adelie') ~ bill_length_mm + flipper_length_mm,
            family = 'binomial', 
            data = penguins),
  # 500 axis based trees
  ranger = ranger(species ~ bill_length_mm + flipper_length_mm,
                  data = penguins,
                  num.trees = 500)
)

```

1 oblique tree with 10 splits takes longer than 500 axis-based trees 😩

## `aorsf`

@jaeger2022aorsf: Accelerated oblique random (survival) forest

- We take the approach of minimizing $R$

- Instead of fitting a full regression model, we 

    + Avoid scaling during regression (minimize data copying)
    
    + Relax convergence criteria (e.g., use just 1 iteration)
    
While model convergence is vital for valid statistical inference, it isn't that big of a deal for finding oblique splits. Remember, we just have to do slightly better than random guessing.

## Benchmark

Minimizing $R$ helps.

```{r, echo=TRUE, cache=TRUE}

microbenchmark(
  ODRF = ODRF(species ~ bill_length_mm + flipper_length_mm, 
              data = penguins, 
              ntrees = 500),
  aorsf = orsf(species ~ bill_length_mm + flipper_length_mm, 
              data = penguins, 
              n_tree = 500),
  ranger = ranger(species ~ bill_length_mm + flipper_length_mm,
                  data = penguins,
                  num.trees = 500),
  times = 5
)

```

## More benchmarks

@jaeger2024accelerated compare `aorsf` to `obliqueRSF`:

- Evaluated in 35 risk prediction tasks (21 datasets)

- Measured computation time and C-statistic.

- Used Bayesian linear mixed models to test for differences.

---

## Computation time

`aorsf` over 300 times faster than `obliqueRSF`

![](img/fig_bm_2.png){width=100% fig-align="center"}

## C-statistic

`aorsf` practically equivalent to `obliqueRSF`

![](img/fig_bm_3.png){width=100% fig-align="center"}

# Applications of `aorsf`

## Data

I'll use Alzheimer's disease data (`ad_data`) from the `modeldata` package.

```{r, echo=TRUE}

library(modeldata)
glimpse(ad_data, width = 100)

```

## Model fitting


:::{.column width="44%"}

Formula interface 

- Similar to other R packages

- Shortcut: `outcome ~ .`

```{r, echo=TRUE, results='hide'}

library(aorsf)
fit <- orsf(ad_data, Class ~ .)

```

:::

:::{.column width="55%"}

```{r}
fit
```

## Your turn

Open `classwork/03-oblique_forests.qmd` and complete Exercise 1

```{r ex-1}
#| echo: false
# countdown::countdown(minutes = 5, id = "ex-1")
```

## Partial dependence

**Purpose**: Interpret a model by evaluating its predictions on special data.

**Example**: Expected prediction from the model as a function of age. 

**Pseudo-code**: `for i in seq(min_age, max_age)`:

- Set all values of `age` to `i` in the training data

- Compute out-of-bag predictions for training data

- Save the mean prediction and `i`

## Single variable summary

Similar to `summary()`, `orsf_summarize_uni()` computes out-of-bag partial dependence on the number of variables you request. 

```{r, echo=TRUE}

orsf_summarize_uni(fit, n_variables = 1, class = "Impaired")

```

## Multi-variable summary

See if predictors interact (they don't in this case)

```{r, echo=TRUE}

pd <- orsf_pd_oob(fit, pred_spec_auto(tau, Genotype))

```

```{r}

gg_data <- filter(pd, class == "Impaired")

ggplot(gg_data) +
  aes(x = tau, y = mean, color = Genotype) + 
  geom_line()

```

## Your turn

Complete exercise 2

```{r ex-2}
#| echo: false
# countdown::countdown(minutes = 5, id = "ex-2")
```

## Variable selection

We want to remove predictors that don't have any prognostic value.

- `orsf_vs()` performs recursive feature elimination.

- Fit a forest and estimate importance

- Drop the least important predictor

- Repeat until < `n_predictor_min` predictors left.

```{r, echo=TRUE}

orsf_vars <- orsf_vs(fit, 
                     n_predictor_min = 1, 
                     verbose_progress = TRUE)

```

## Faster

**If needed**, reduce `n_tree` and increase `leaf_min_obs` to speed this up

```{r, echo=TRUE}

fit_light <- orsf_update(fit, n_tree = 100, leaf_min_obs = 20)

orsf_vars_light <- orsf_vs(fit_light, n_predictor_min = 1, verbose_progress = TRUE)

```

## Pick your variables

Plot the history of performance and variables included.

:::{.column width="49%"}

```{r echo=TRUE}

max_auc <- orsf_vars %>% 
  arrange(desc(stat_value)) %>% 
  slice(1)

fig <- ggplot(orsf_vars) + 
  aes(x = n_predictors,
      y = stat_value) + 
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) + 
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE, 
              linewidth = 1) + 
  geom_point(data = max_auc, 
             size = 3, 
             color = 'purple')

```

## Your turn

```{r ex-3}
#| echo: false
# countdown::countdown(minutes = 5, id = "ex-3")

## Compare models

For causal random forests, we'll need *good* prediction models for both dementia and APOE4 status.

- Developing and evaluating prediction models is a deep topic. 

- We will cover the basics:

    + Data splitting
    
    + Pre-processing
    
    + Evaluating in test data

We'll do this using the `tidymodels` framework.

## Data splitting

If you evaluate prediction models with their training data, you

- Reward models that overfit the data.

- Don't learn much about what will happen in the real world.

So, always evaluate prediction models with data that is "new"

```{r, echo=TRUE, results='hide', eval=FALSE}

library(rsample)
set.seed(1234)
# make the split: 50% training data, 50% testing
split <- initial_split(data = ad_data, prop = 1/2)
# get the training data
train <- training(split)
# get the testing data
test <- testing(split)


```

## Pre-processing

Why do we pre-process data?

- Some models require special data format

- Impute missing values correctly

- Sometimes its helpful to apply transformations to data prior to modeling

We'll train our pre-processing steps using the `recipes` package 

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}

library(recipes)

# Makes the recipe steps
recipe_steps <- recipe(data = train, Class ~ .) %>% 
  step_impute_knn(all_predictors()) %>% 
  step_dummy(all_nominal_predictors())

```

## Training the recipe

With its steps defined, we are ready to

- train the recipe 

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
# train the recipe steps with training data
recipe_trained <- prep(recipe_steps, training = train)
```

- use it to process the training and testing data.

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}

# apply the recipe steps to process training data
train_processed <- bake(recipe_trained, new_data = train)
# apply the exact same steps to the testing data
test_processed <- bake(recipe_trained, new_data = test)

```

## Fitting models

- `parsnip` is a unified interface for models with R. 

- `bonsai` extends `parsnip`, focusing on decision tree models.

With these packages, we make a model *specification*, and then *fit* it.

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}

library(parsnip)
library(bonsai)

# make model specifications
ranger_spec <- rand_forest(mode = 'classification', engine = 'ranger')
aorsf_spec  <- rand_forest(mode = 'classification', engine = 'aorsf')

# fit them
ranger_fit <- fit(ranger_spec, data = train_processed, formula = Class ~ .)
aorsf_fit  <- fit(aorsf_spec,  data = train_processed, formula = Class ~ .)

```

```{r}

library(ranger)
library(aorsf)
library(ODRF)
library(rsample)
library(recipes)

set.seed(329)
# make the split: 50% training data, 50% testing
split <- initial_split(data = ad_data, prop = 1/2)
# get the training data
train <- training(split)
# get the testing data
test <- testing(split)

# Makes the recipe steps
recipe_steps <- recipe(data = train, Class ~ .) %>% 
  step_impute_knn(all_predictors()) %>% 
  step_dummy(all_nominal_predictors())

# train the recipe steps with training data
recipe_trained <- prep(recipe_steps, training = train)

# apply the recipe steps to process training data
train_processed <- bake(recipe_trained, new_data = train)
# apply the exact same steps to the testing data
test_processed <- bake(recipe_trained, new_data = test)

vars <- orsf(train_processed, formula = Class ~ .) %>% 
  orsf_vs(n_predictor_min = 1)

top <- which.max(vars$stat_value)

vars_picked <- c(fit$get_names_y(), vars$predictors_included[top][[1]])

# fit
ranger_fit <- ranger(formula = Class ~ ., train_processed, probability = TRUE)
aorsf_fit  <- orsf(train_processed[, vars_picked], formula = Class ~ .)
odrf_fit  <- ODRF(formula = Class ~ ., data = train_processed)

# predict
aorsf_prd <- predict(aorsf_fit, new_data = test_processed)[, 2]
ranger_prd <- predict(ranger_fit, test_processed)$predictions[, 2]
odrf_prd <- predict(odrf_fit, 
                    Xnew = as.matrix(select(test_processed, -Class)),
                    type = 'prob')[, 1]

preds <- list(aorsf = aorsf_prd, 
              ranger = ranger_prd,
              odrf = odrf_prd) %>% 
  map_dfr( ~ tibble(pred = .x, 
                    truth = test_processed$Class),
           .id = 'model')

```


## Evaluating in test data

We predict probabilities for observations in the testing data, and evaluate discrimination using the `yardstick` package:

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}

preds <- list(aorsf = aorsf_fit, ranger = ranger_fit) %>% 
  map(~ predict(.x, new_data = test_processed, type = 'prob')) %>% 
  map(~ mutate(.x, truth = test_processed$Class)) %>% 
  bind_rows(.id = 'model')

library(yardstick)

preds %>% 
  group_by(model) %>% 
  roc_auc(truth = truth, .pred_Impaired)

```

```{r}
library(yardstick)

preds %>% 
  group_by(model) %>% 
  roc_auc(truth = truth, pred, event_level = 'second')
```

## To the pipeline


- Copy/paste this code into your `_targets.R` file. 

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}

# Around line 87 of the file, you should see this comment: 

# real data model targets (to be added as an exercise). 

# Paste this code right beneath that.

fit_aorsf_zzzz_tar <- tar_target(
  fit_aorsf_zzzz,
  fit_orsf_clsf(data = data_zzzz)
)

```

- Modify this code, replacing `zzzz` with the name of your dataset.
